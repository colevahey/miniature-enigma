# miniature-enigma
Miniature-enigma is an encoder and decoder written using Python and JSON. This code is written in Python and JSON. The code program creates a random assignment for every letter in the alphabet and other special characters. The user can then call the `runner` file and it will ask "What is your message?". The user can input a message and they are returned with the encoded version of their message. The user can then call the `runner` function again, enter their returned message, and receive their original message back. This can be useful for communication across users because as long as the letter assignments are not changed, the encoded messages will return the original message on __any__ machine. There is also now a rot program which will rotate all the letters in a message to any other ascii character. I have since created a website for this project which is up and running at [cvenigma.ml](http://cvenigma.ml).
