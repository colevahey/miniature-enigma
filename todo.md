###September 3:
I have almost finished my encoder. I believe I can still add more
characters to the library of my encoder and decoder. This way, the
messages can include numbers and punctuation. The decoder works and
I may have to expand the scope of my project.

###September 10:
I finished the encoder and decoder. I think I will create a web
interface using some Golang for the website. This will help me learn
about servers and web interfaces.
